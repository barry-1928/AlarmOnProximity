# AlarmOnProximity

The following are the general information and guidelines regarding the "AlarmOnProximity" app.

1. The "AlarmOnProximity" app uses the Proximity Sensor of your android device and finds whether you are far or near your phone.
2. The moment you are near your phone, it starts the countdown from 10 seconds and the alarm starts ringing when the countdown value falls to zero.
3. If you go away from the phone, the timer resets to 10 seconds and if the alarm is ringing, it stops ringing.
4. The task is accomplished by using AsyncTask for playing the ringtone in a background thread, while the timer works on the UI Thread or the Main Thread.
5. The ringtone that is played is the default alarm ringtone of your device.

Hope you enjoy the app.

Thank You.
